UUID's are perhaps not the most accurate term, but it's the one
I've adopted in this codebase. They are closer to cryptographic
nonces, and are generated as such, but are opaque base64 blocks
to identify individual operations that require server-side data
to be stored between web-requests, to avoid stalling the client
when waiting for remote data such as third-party API calls, and
internal database lookups/writes.

Session State:

userid: <authenticated internal id, ALWAYS padded to 15 digits>
<service>_uuid: Internal uuid used for tracking state of logins



/initlogin/<service>	Support URL for oauth1-based login mechanisms

	If '${service}_uuid' session variable does NOT exist:
		Generate UUID

		Set '${service}_uuid_${UUID}' keyvalue to 'wip'

		Set '${service}_uuid' session variable to UUID

	307-Redirect to '/preauth/${service}'

/preauth/<service>	'Holding tank' URL for oauth1-based login mechanisms

	If '${service}_uuid' session variables does NOT exist:
		307-Redirect to '/initlogin/${service}'

	If '${service}_uuid_${UUID}' keyvalue DOESN'T exist:
		Possible replay attack attempt, BOOT!

		Delete '${service}_uuid' session variable

		307-Redirect to '/'

	Check status of '${service}_uuid_${UUID}' keyvalue:
		'wip'
			Meta-refresh to myself w/ 1-second delay

		'error:'
		default
			Delete '${service}_uuid_${UUID}' keyvalue

			Delete '${service}_uuid' session variable

			Present error page w/ click to homepage

		'ready:'
			Store session variables for service-specific values

			307-Redirect to calculated ${login_URL}



/login/<service>	Return callback for each service

	Verify required parameters in session and request exist and sync.

	If anything is missing/broken, error page and WAIT for client to click.

	Delete unrequired session variables

	Set keyvalue 'login_${service}_${uuid}' to 'wip' state

	Redirect client to '/login'

	Begin processing request

	On request error or request response lacking required elements...
		Update keyvalue to 'error:${error_message}'

	...otherwise...
		Process login including merging accounts if needed

		Update keyvalue to 'ready:${userid}'



/login			Main login endpoint

	List servics supported

	If 'login_${service}' session value exists:

		Store as UUID

		Check status of 'login_${service}_${uuid}' keyvalue:

		'wip'
			Set 'processing' flag on login-icon
			Disable link
			Set meta-refresh for 1 second to /login

		'error:'
			Set 'error' flag on login-icon
			Link to specific error/troubleshooting page

		'ready:'
			Delete keyvalue
			Set 'userid' session variable to attached value



/			Main Homepage
	If logged out:
		Describe website

	Provide links to sub-systems:
		Login Management (link to /login)
		Profile Management (link to /profile)
