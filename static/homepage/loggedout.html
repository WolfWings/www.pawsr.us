<p>Welcome to www.pawsr.us, a website for sharing your contact details with others in a way you control, with a focus on security and working well by treating
mobile devices as first-class citizens of our websites without relying on dedicated apps.</p>
<p>Note that we will never ask you to register or setup an account on this site: We rely on industry-standard OAuth2 and OpenID protocols to allow you to
"login" entirely via third-party websites: We never see, access, or store any form of password here on this site, to avoid any risk of compromise.</p>
